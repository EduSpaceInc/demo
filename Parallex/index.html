When the BJP won a massive victory in 2014, the defence ministry was first handed over to Arun Jaitley. He held the dual charge along with that of finance. Later Manohar Parrikar was drafted in from Goa. The first chance that he got, the IIT graduate decided to return to Panjim to lead a fragile coalition. The baton was again handed over to Jaitley till a replacement was found.

Prime Ministers in the past have shown great care in choosing their defence ministers. Aspirants are gauged on broadly three parameters- probity, loyalty and political experience.
